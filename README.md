# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview-Technologies Used

- Figma
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Git

This project is a web page designed to be interactive, where the user can create and edit a user profile and "like", add or remove photos of places around the US. It is an adaptable and responsive design that can be viewed on a desktop or mobile screen. I think this design and website concept has capabilites to be a travel based site similar to a combination of Instagram and Pinterest, where a user could embed links to travel itinerary ideas, accomodation or restaurant suggestions, or even travel journals within the added photos.
